# Natural Language Processing for Narratives

**A creative pipeline blending news aggregation, text clustering, and editorial generation using LLMs.**

This project explores how large language models can assist in understanding and framing current events. Using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, I built a lightweight NLP pipeline that fetches top news headlines via an API, clusters them by textual similarity using TF-IDF, and generates thematic editorial frameworks using Microsoft's MAI DS R1 LLM. The goal was to translate scattered headlines into coherent, emotionally resonant narratives.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python: Pandas, Scikit-learn, GNews API
- NLP: TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, Agglomerative Clustering
- LLM: OpenRouter (OpenAI, Microsoft's MAI DS R1)

## ðŸ’¡ Key Themes
- Narrative clustering for noisy news
- Prompt engineering for editorial generation
- Emotional framing and thematic synthesis
